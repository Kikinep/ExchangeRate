<h3 align="center">Java project to make currency conversions with requests from an API</h3>

1 - Allows the user to choose from any valid Currency Code to make requests to the [Exchange Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to make a conversion.

2 - Keeps a history of all the conversion made that can be accessed at any time.

3 - Handles all (Hopefully) Exceptions that could occur during runtime.
